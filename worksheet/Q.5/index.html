// 1.    Error-Based Debugging:
// Identify why the following function outputs undefined and fix it:
console.log(name);
var name = "JavaScript";

// 2. Explanation Task:
// Record a 5-minute video explaining the concept of call stacks and how they manage nested function calls.

//3. Output-Based Question:
// Write a program demonstrating the creation of multiple FECs with a recursive function to calculate factorials.

// 4.how does this behave differently in the global execution context compared to FEC?
