    // 1. Error-Based Debugging:
    // Fix the issue with the following arrow function:
    const multiply = (a, b) => (a * b);
    console.log(multiply(2, 3)); // Expected Output: 6

    // 2. Explanation Task:
    // Record a 5-minute video explaining the difference between declarative and arrow functions, focusing on their this behavior.

    // 3. Output-Based Question:
    // Create a higher-order function that takes a callback (anonymous or arrow function) and applies it to double each value in an array.
    //Input: [1, 2, 3]
    // Expected Output: [2, 4, 6]
    let arr = [1, 2, 3];
    let res = arr.map((el) => {
        return el * 2;
    })
    console.log(res);

    //4. Related Topic Question:
    // How do arrow functions differ from function expressions in terms of scope and this behavior? Provide an example.
    //ANS :-
